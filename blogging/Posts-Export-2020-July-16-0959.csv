12,Magic Bibliography: Scholarly and Professional Research into Theatrical Magic,https://magicperspectives.net/magic-bibliography/,1454794966,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This magic bibliography provides a comprehensive list of scholarly and professional literature on conjuring. Researchers have asked questions about theatrical magic from diverse disciplines; from dentistry and linguistics to management and gender studies. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The relationship between science and magic is complex. Scholars from many different fields have <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/researching-theatrical-magic/"">studied performance magic</a>. Magicians often use the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/the-scientific-methods-of-magic/"">principles of science</a> to seemingly breaks the laws of nature. Magic and science have a <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/relationship-between-magic-and-science/"">bidirectional relationship</a> where both fields of human endeavour relate to each other</p>

<h2>Magic Bibliography Categories</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the estimated half a million magicians around the world are amateurs or semi-professionals who work as lawyers, occupational therapists, psychologists, computer scientists, teachers and so on. Many of these scientists and professionals have written scholarly papers and books about their passion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word ‘science’ usually relates to the natural sciences, such as physics. The scientific work on conjuring illustrates that science is a much broader concept than the physical sciences alone. The science of magic discusses the full spectrum of human experience and the natural world. There are broadly four <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science#Applied_sciences"" rel=""noopener"">branches of science</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Natural or physical sciences</em>: cosmology, geology, chemistry and biology.</li><li><em>Formal sciences</em>: mathematics and logic.</li><li><em>Social sciences</em>: psychology, sociology and the humanities.</li><li><em>Applied sciences</em>: engineering, medicine and computer science.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To fully understand a complex phenomenon such as theatrical magic, scientists use a range of perspectives beyond the natural sciences. Scientists and professionals from two of the four domains of science have studied the art of conjuring, each asking their specific questions of magic. The word-cloud below visualises the relative frequency of each of the entries in this magic bibliography.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teachers can use magic tricks to help their students understand abstract concepts of mathematics and physics as many tricks are based on these sciences. Performing magic stimulates the curiosity of students and motivates them to find out the principles of science that were used to create magic. A large amount of literature has been published on the topic.</p>

<h3>Film Studies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic and cinema have a lot in common in that they both rely on deception. Magicians, such as Georges Méliès, and Charles Pathé, were some of the first film exhibitors, performers and producers. Their efforts started the development of special effects as a narrative device. The literature in the genre reviews what role magicians played in the spread of cinema and how they responded to its popularity.</p>

<h3>Gender Studies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic is one of the few male-dominated performance arts. Less than five per cent of people actively involved in theatrical magic are women. In other performance arts, more than one-third of performers are female. Gender studies explore the possible reasons for the imbalance between men and women in magic as a performance art.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many magicians have an avid interest in the history of their passion, but their accounts are not considered of high value to academic historians as these writings mostly omit to place magic in a wider historical context. Until very recently, social historians had no real interest in magic. The past decade has, however, seen a steady flow of monographs critically analysing conjuring’s place in society through the ages.</p>

<h3>Information Technology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both software designers and magicians create virtual realities. Software designers bring their reality alive on computer displays; magicians bring theirs alive on the stage. Developing a computer interface is akin to performing a magic trick because a computer screen is a simulated reality. Several academic papers have been written that describe the similarities between magic and information technology.</p>

137,Geometric Magic Tricks: Conjuring with Size,https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-magic-tricks/,1456575106,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geometry is one of the most rational human pursuits, but it can also be used to create theatrical magic. Many magic tricks involve geometry as changing something's size is one one the basic magic effects. Geometric magic tricks  tricks use geometry as a method. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article shows how magicians can uses <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/relationship-between-magic-and-science/"">principles of the science</a> of mathematics and geometry to create illusion of magic. The first section discusses the famous Gozinta Boxes and the last section introduces geometric vanishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Gozinta Boxes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/gozinta-boxes/"">Gozinta Boxes</a> are a famous example of magic with geometry. The basic effect is a <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/topological-magic-tricks/"">topological</a> mystery where two boxes fit inside each other. The method for this trick is a clever application of geometry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lubor Fiedler discovered the principle behind the gozinta box when tidying his house. He placed two empty boxes into each other and noticed how they seemed to fit almost perfectly. This real-life situation inspired him to develop the Lubor Die, which later became known as the Gozinta Boxes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Gozinta Box Performances</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The subtlety to of the plot of the Gozinta Box routine requires a careful presentation to achieve the maximum effect. These videos provide some inspiration on how to handle the boxes.</p>

<h3>Gozinta Box Geometry</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lubor Fiedler discovered the principle behind the gozinta box when tidying his house. He placed two empty boxes into each other and noticed how they seemed to fit almost perfectly. A Gozinta Box consists of two hollow cubes with perceived rib size a and wall thickness $latex t$. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can use mathematics to prove that a gozinta box is magical. The following equation ensures that the boxes fit into each other: $latex a^3 = (a - t)^3$. This formula expresses symbolically that the volume of the outside of the cube $latex a^3$, is equal to the volume of the inside of the cube: $latex (a - t)^3$ . This equation is only valid when either the wall thickness $latex t = 0$, or when the rib length approaches infinity, a $latex \rightarrow \infty $. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The absurdity of zero wall thickness or infinite cube size expresses the magical quality of the gozinta box. When the wall thickness is zero, the boxes consist of only space and imaginary boxes will naturally fit perfectly into each other. Cubes of infinite size are magical because they are simply beyond contemplation.<br></p>

<h2>Geometric Vanishes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A geometric vanish is a situation where a set of tiles can create two shapes with apparently different surface areas. There are three types of geometric vanishes that magicians can use to create the illusion of magic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Vanishing Leprechaun</li><li>Curry Paradox</li><li>Tangram Paradox</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/optical-illusions-in-magic-tricks/"">Visual illusions</a> are a natural form of magic because our mind cannot help being deceived by some geometrical patterns. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jastrow_illusion"">Jastrow Illusion</a> is one of the most common visual illusions.

<p>The Gozinta Boxes have captivated magicians since Lubor Fiedler first introduced the trick in the 1970 FISM convention. In this mystery, a small box fits inside a large box but paradoxically, the large box also 'goes in da' the little box. Lubor Fiedler invented this topological mystery when he ran out of space in his house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Box Goes-In-Da Box</em> gives a detailed history of the Gozinta Boxes plot. Since Lubor introduced the idea, many versions have been released on the market. The book also contains detailed instructions on how to create Gozinta Boxes, using nothing but some cardboard, a knife and some glue. For the mathematically-minded reader, the book provides the detailed workings of gozinta geometry, including a version with three boxes.</p>

<p>The Möbius strip is one of the most enigmatic principles of mathematics. A simple loop of paper transforms in unexpected ways when cut in half. This principle has inspired mathematicians, inventors, an artists. Magicians have used this topological principle to create the illusion of magic under the name Afghan Bands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This trick is now relegated to magic for children. But this was not always the case. Famous magicians such as Harry Blackstone and Nelson Downs regularly performed it in the stage act. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The history of this trick is a fascinating story about how magicians innovate their art using a simple principle. This history is also a tale of accusations of plagiarism. Magicians have accused each other of stealing over the many improvements made to this trick over the decades</p>

844,Afghan Zipper: Topological magic with Haberdashery,https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-zipper/,1521500628,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Afghan Zipper is a topological magic trick that uses the Möbius Strip principle to create the illusion of magic. This trick is the most recent innovation in the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-bands/"">Afghan Bands</a>, one of the most well-known magic tricks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic plot of this minor mystery is that the magician cuts a circular strip of paper lengthwise in half. Instead of producing the expected two separate rings, the magical version results in a band twice the size of the original. The magician repeats these actions and creates two linked rings or even a long loop with a knot. Performers initially used paper of cloth bands to perform this trick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Afghan Zipper</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a zipper to create reusable Möbius strips first appeared in the magic literature in 1977 by Ed Eckl in his&nbsp;<em>Gardyloo</em>&nbsp;lecture notes under the name Möby Zip. The trick was briefly marketed in the early 1980s by Phil Wallmart's and Rick Johnson's Excelsior Productions. In 1992 Klamm Magic advertised their version as the Afghan Zipper which used Velcro ends. It was accompanied by a gospel&nbsp;script and the well-known circus script. In that same year, Dick Stoner sold this trick under the punny name ""Did you ever see an elephant fly?"" The puns did not end there. Peter Marucci removed the zipper from an empty jar of Vaseline, saying: ""Look! A fly in the ointment!""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {""url"":""https://youtu.be/2jsLrhfOE00"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""youtube"",""className"":""wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""} -->

https://youtu.be/2jsLrhfOE00
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The various zipper versions have also led to accusations of plagiarism and piracy in the magic literature. Eckl writes in his lecture notes that he developed the ""gag"", as he calls it, in the early 1970s and that he has never seen anyone else performing it. Irrespective of these accusations, using zippers as Möbius strips is not unique to magicians as mathematicians have since long used zippers to play with one-sided geometry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The internet contains several references to Möbius strip zippers, both as an educational tool and as a form of entertainment. Daniel Morris even patented the Möbius strip zipper in 1985. The patent claim relates to a puzzle made from zippers twisted into a single-sided surface. This puzzle was never commercialised, and the patent expired in 1991 due to a failure to pay the maintenance fee.</p>

884,Boomerang Illusion Template,https://magicperspectives.net/boomerang-illusion-template/,1521714277,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians have performed the boomerang illusion for almost as long as psychologists have studied it. Over the past century, a wide variety of versions of this illusion has been published and marketed under many different names. The oldest known reference to the Jastrow illusion as a magic trick is from a 1916 book by Will Goldston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians have over the past century been creative in seeking ways to incorporate the Jastrow illusion in their repertoire. The boomerang illusion has seen many interpretations and is, without a doubt, the most famous piece of magic based on an optical illusion. Magicians often lament that performing this optical&nbsp;illusion as an effect is not magic. This lack of magic is true in the sense that these tricks will not ‘kill’ or ‘fry’ your audience, but it certainly can create a magical experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians tend to underestimate the power of the Jastrow illusion magic trick. Its use in magic is limited to children's entertainers and magic kits.&nbsp;This illusion is more powerful than it seems at first sight. A&nbsp;recent viral video shows that its deceptive power is as strong as it was when first discovered almost 150 years ago.</p>

987,The Bidirectional Relationship Between Magic and Science,https://magicperspectives.net/relationship-between-magic-and-science/,1523565324,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scientists often describe the relationship between magic and science as opposed to each other. In this view, magicians break the laws of physics. They can change the world in ways ordinary people cannot. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our mind is conditioned to view the world as a chain of cause and effect. Reading somebody's mind, mutilating pretty girls without harming them or cause coins to disappear without causality between the actions and the results is not possible in our everyday experience. This view diametrically opposes magic and science as two incompatible human endeavours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The relationship between magic and science is much more complex than this simple view,  as Arthur C. Clarke famously expressed in the last of his <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""three laws (opens in a new tab)"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws"" target=""_blank"">three laws</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic""</p><cite>Arthur C. Clarke, <em>Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible.</em></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The closest we can come in our every days life to supernatural magic is the theatrical magic, or conjuring. Magicians are actors who play the role of a supernatural magician.  This form of art has a very close and bidirectional relationship with the various sciences. Magicians use science to create the illusion of magic and scientists study magicians and their audiences. This essay discusses the bidirectional relationship between magic and science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Science of Theatrical Magic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians present theatrical illusions that seemingly breach the laws of the physical sciences, but they often deploy the principles of these and other sciences to create these illusions. Scientists are interested in magic because they seek to understand this unique performance art better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The relationship between science and magic is thus bi-directional. <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/scientific-magic-tricks/"">Magicians use science</a> to create the illusion of supernatural magic, while <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/researching-theatrical-magic/"">scientists study magicians</a> and their craft to learn more about the world around us. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The diagram below visualises the relationship between magic and science. The outer circle show the sciences that are involved with magic. Performers use some of these sciences as methods to create the illusion of magic. Scientists in most of these fields research magicians and their performances. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This model divides the science in formal, physical, social and applied sciences. The formal sciences, such as mathematics, help us to understand the world but they are not empirical. The physical sciences, such as physics and chemistry, describe the material world in a mathematical way. The social sciences study human beings in all its facets. The social sciences study human individuals through psychology, how they work together in a group through sociology. Lastly, the social sciences study the artefacts of human culture, one of which is theatrical magic</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of these sciences has a different relationship with theatrical magic. Some sciences are used by magicians to perform their tricks, while other sciences are used by scholars as a perspective of magic. Some sciences perform both roles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine you are in a small magic theatre, the conjurer introduces two cups and two little balls. Using a magic wand, he commands the balls to dematerialise from his bare hands and materialise under the cups. The balls seem possessed by supernatural powers as they disappear, reappear and penetrate solid matter at the mere whim of the magician. This supernatural choreography ends with a giant pompom appearing under the cups, leaving the spectators mystified and amused. The video below shows a masterful performance of this ancient magic trick by the Dutch master, the late Tommy Wonder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHcsLyFrqx0"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""youtube"",""className"":""wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio""} -->

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHcsLyFrqx0
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the magician entertains the audience, a nagging thought lingers in their minds:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><em>How did he do it?</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know magic is not real but what Tommy Wonder just showed seems like a miracle. Among the spectators is a group of university colleagues who reflect intellectually on what they just experienced. They enjoyed the show as much as everyone else, but their questions are different from the rest of the audience. These issues are frankly a lot more interesting than knowing how the magician did the magic trick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The psychologist wonders how it is possible that the performer so easily deceived his mind. How is it possible that people can be tricked to see something that contradicts our common sense view of the world? The psychologist’s friend, a professor of humanities also enjoyed the show. She wonders how the pompom appeared under the cups like everybody else, but she also asks questions about the cultural significance of magic why it has remained popular for millennia, across different cultures. Her husband, who works as an occupational therapist at the local hospital, is also an amateur magician. He contemplates the incredible hand-eye coordination and muscle control required to perform the trick he just saw, and he wonders whether he could apply magic skills to his profession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic is a unique performance art that can teach us a lot about how humans relate to reality. Although magic tricks are always a game of wits between the spectator and the performer, a great magic show conveys a more profound message about our relationship with the world. Studying the relationship between magic and science helps us to better understand how we experience the world</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Scientific Methods of Magic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most obvious science that performers use to create the illusion of magic is psychology.  This science studies how we perceive the world around us and how we interpret the information we receive to our senses. Our mind is fallible in how it reconstructs the world, which gives rise to misdirection and <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/say-cheese"">optical illusions</a>, which are nature's own magic tricks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many magic tricks use the principles of mathematics to perform tricks. Number theory, <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/topological-magic-tricks/"">topology</a> and <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-magic-tricks/"">geometry</a> inspire magician to perform what they call automatic tricks. These tricks follow an algorithm with a predictable outcome.</p>

<h2>Researching Theatrical Magic<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/magic-bibliography/"">scholarly bibliography</a> of theatrical magic contains hundreds of references to academic and professional literature that describes theatrical magic.</p>

1114,Perspectives on Magic: Scientific Views of Theatrical Magic,https://magicperspectives.net/perspectives-on-magic/,1370044812,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Perspectives on Magic</em> is a book about the relationship between science and magic. When watching a magician, the question that is most pressing on people's minds is ""how did he do it""? This question is not the only one that the audience asks of a magic performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A psychologist might ask how a magician deceives the mind. Likewise, occupational therapists are interested in how performing magic tricks can help people with physical disabilities, and sociologists research the subculture of magicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Magic Perspectives</em>&nbsp;explores some of the answers to the questions that scholars from different fields of science have asked about the performances of magicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For magicians, this book provides new perspectives on their art. For people with a passive interest in magic, this book offers an insight into this quaint performance art.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Perspectives on Magic</em> discusses the following questions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>How can we define theatrical magic?</li><li>How does magic relate to science?</li><li>Is magic a performance art?</li><li>What is it like to be a magician?</li><li>What role did magicians play in history?</li><li>What is the practical use of conjuring?</li><li>What can we learn from magic tricks?</li><li>How can a magician deceive us?</li><li>Will magic eventually become obsolete?</li><li>What is the science of magic?</li><li><a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/magic-bibliography/"">Bibliography</a> of the science of magic.</li></ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/relationship-between-magic-and-science/"">relationship between science and magic</a> is bidirectional. Scientists study many aspects of magic and magicians use the principles of science to create illusions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sciences can be divided in several domains, such as the formal sciences, physical sciences, social sciences and the applied sciences. Magicians uses methods derived from each of these categories of science. This article briefly discusses the scientific methods of magic for each of these four .</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Formal Sciences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The formal sciences are those fields of enquiry without a direct relationship to reality. Sciences such as mathematics and computing don't study nature or humans, but purely abstract concepts of numbers, shapes or algorithms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians use the formal sciences as methods for magic tricks. Some tricks apply mathematical principles to create the illusion of magic. Magicians often call these tricks 'self-working' because they rely on a process, rather than a unique skill. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most mathematical magic tricks use numbers as a method to create a magic effect. Magicians also use other branches of mathematics, such as <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-magic-tricks/"">geometry</a> and <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/topological-magic-tricks/"">topology</a>, to perform magic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This video of an 1991 David Copperfield television show is an example of beautiful magic created by an algorithm. Mathematics teacher <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Sydney Kolpas (opens in a new tab)"" href=""https://web.northeastern.edu/seigen/11Magic/Teaching/David%20Copperfields%20Orient%20Express%20Card%20Trick.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Sydney Kolpas</a> wrote a paper about the principles behind this trick. The beauty of mathematical magic tricks is that because they are algorithmic and always work, the trick is purely a theatrical performance.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Physical Sciences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The physical sciences study the lifeless world through physics and  chemistry, which magicians apply to perform magic tricks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A famous  example is a <em>Light and Heavy Chest</em>, which uses electromagnets  to create the illusion that its weight has increased. This method was  used by nineteenth-century magician Jean-Eugène Robert Houdin to convince Algerian rebels that the French were more powerful than them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Social Sciences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most magic tricks deploy principles of psychology to create the illusion of the impossible. Misdirection is the fundamental principle of most magic. Many psychologists have studied this phenomenon in great detail. In a narrow sense, misdirection is about diverting the spectator's attention away from the secret action that creates the illusion of magic. More accurately, misdirection is about directing the attention of the spectator to those parts of the performance that shape the narrative, instead of the technical method.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Applied Sciences</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians often build elaborate apparatus that requires a reasonable level of knowledge of engineering to make sure they are safe to use. Engineering, including information technology, can also be used as a method to create the illusion of magic. Many magicians are very creative in their design and construction of magical apparatus. This short overview of methods in magic is surely not exhaustive.</p>

<p>Scholars in the social sciences and the humanities have extensively studied magic from a wide variety of topics. This section only mentions three main areas of interest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social scientists have researched gender issues in magic. The vast majority of magicians are male, and women mostly perform a passive role as they are the ones being cut in half. Why is this the case, is magic a reflection of society or is it even more male-oriented? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians are fascinated by the history of their craft, and recently professional historians started writing about magic performances of the past. One such topic is the role magicians played in the development of film as a form of entertainment. The earliest film makers, such a Georges Méliès, were magicians who invented many of the techniques in special effects. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another example of the social science of magic are anthropologists who study the subculture of magicians. Because magicians surround their work in secrecy, they form strong ties with each other to discuss their craft in a safe surrounding. These studies are exciting as the Internet has revolutionised how information is shared between people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic tricks can also have a purpose beyond frivolous entertainment. Professionals from many areas use magic tricks in their day job. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the formal and physical sciences do not study magicians, teachers in these subjects use magic methods to explain the abstract principles of their science to students. Magic tricks are especially effective to teach abstract mathematics because they can visualise many principles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic tricks are also popular with people that work in healthcare. Clown doctors help to reduce anxiety in little patients, and occupational therapists use magic to help people recover from injuries.</p>

1515,Topological Magic Tricks: Shapes as a Method for Deception,https://magicperspectives.net/topological-magic-tricks/,1546039981,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians often use the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/the-scientific-methods-of-magic/"">principles of science as a method</a> to create the illusion that real magic has occurred. Mathematics is one of the sciences that magicians love to exploit to deceive their audiences entertainingly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most tricks that use mathematics, such as the many card routines, rely on number theory through counting and sorting patterns. Some magic tricks, such as the enigmatic vanishing square puzzles, use <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-magic-tricks/"">principles of geometry</a>. A small subgroup of scientific magic tricks uses topology as a method in magic<g class=""gr_ gr_23 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep"" id=""23"" data-gr-id=""23"">.</g></p>

<h2>What is topology<g class=""gr_ gr_17 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep"" id=""17"" data-gr-id=""17"">?</g></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word topology was first introduced by the 19th-century German mathematician Johann Listing. He is also known for simultaneously discovering what is now known as the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-bands/"">Möbius strip</a>. Topology is a branch of mathematics concerned with the (<em>logos)</em> of space (<em>topos</em>). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mathematicians involved with topology study transform into other shapes. To a topologist, a doughnut made from silly putty is equivalent to a coffee mug because one can be transformed into the other without drilling holes or adding material. Another favourite past time of topologists is the study of knots.  One of the major problems in knot theory is determining whether a knot is actually a knot, or just a tangled mess. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Topology is an artful and speculative branch of mathematics, but it also has many practical applications. Topology is an essential input into many technologies we rely on, such as the internet. This form of mathematics also plays a role in physics and biology. Lastly, topology can be used to create the illusion of magic.</p>

<h2>Topological magic tricks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Topology appears in magic as an effect an as a method. Basically, all rope tricks are topological effects. Most tricks with rings involves linking and unlinking them by melting metal through metal. Linking ring tricks feign to violate a principle of topology which states that two closed curves cannot link or unlink without breaking them apart. Magic books also describe a lot of fake knots, with in the vocabulary of topology are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknot"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""unknots (opens in a new tab)"">unknots</a>.</p>

<h3>Afghan Bands</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most famous of all topological magic tricks is the Afghan Bands. This trick uses the Möbius Strip as a technique to create magic. The basic effect is that a loop is cut or ripped in half with unexpected consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Möbius Strip is a two-dimensional loop that paradoxically only has one side. This principle has been studied by magicians, used by inventors and has inspired artists since it was first discovered. Magicians have performed this trick for over a century with paper, cloth and with <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-zipper/"">zippers</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The YouTube playlist below shows the Möbius Strip as a magic trick and some theoretical aspects of this principle. The first video shows Harry Blackstone performing his version with cloth bands which he called the Red Rags.</p>

1541,Optical Illusions as Magic Tricks,https://magicperspectives.net/optical-illusions-in-magic-tricks/,1546040898,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The art of magic creates a world where expectations of the way the world functions are temporarily violated. Magicians use the fact that our mind does not perceive the world as it is to create the illusion of magic. Optical and visual illusions are nature's own magic trick as they expose how our limited perception of the world around us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic is a gift of nature, and the natural phenomenon of optical illusion is one of the many methods that magician use to create illusions. <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/relationship-between-magic-and-science/"">Science and theatrical magic</a> have always gone hand-in-hand. This article describes how magicians can use optical illusions to perform magic tricks.[efn_note]A previous version of this article was published in the German magazine <em>Aladin</em>.[/efn_note]</p>

<h2>Optical Illusions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine that you are sitting on a train. You look out the window and believe that the train is moving. You soon realise that in reality, the neighbouring wagons are moving. After your train finally leaves, you look through the back window, and it seems like the tracks physically meet in the distance, although you know with certainty that they are perfectly parallel to each other. This anecdote is examples of illusions as we experience them in everyday life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychologists have studied the nature of optical illusions to understand how our brain is cheating itself. The study of these illusions also has practical implications. For example, factory control rooms contain many complicated dials and displays that help operators make correct decisions. Engineers design these instruments, so there is no misunderstanding how to interpret the information they display. Another application can be found in traffic engineering. Roads must be designed so that visual information is correctly understood by the driver to reduce the likelihood of accidents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optical illusions are also deliberately introduced to avoid perceptual errors. Ancient Greek architects formed stone pillars in a gentle curve with their base slightly wider than the top, so that they seem perfectly straight. Optical refinements to simulate geometric perfection are common in <a href=""https://amzn.to/2CT6USz"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Doric Greek temple architecture (opens in a new tab)"">Doric Greek temple architecture</a>. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is admired for its architectural perfection. To realise this perfect geometry, the architects Ictinus and Callicrates have curved almost every line in the design and created the illusion of straight lines and geometric perfection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scientists have systematically studied optical illusions since 1855, the year when the German psychologist Joseph Oppel published an article on the subject. Since that first publication, thousands of books and journal articles have been written on the topic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the simplest illusions is the Müller-Lyer illusion. The horizontal lines have the same length, but the arrows inward or outward confuse the brain because the horizontal lines do not seem to be the same size. The German psychologist Franz Carl Müller-Lyer first published this illusion in work on fifteen geometric illusions. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ponzo Illusion is similar to the first example. The converging oblique lines distort our perception of identical horizontal lines. The angled lines cause our brain to recognise the upper line as slightly smaller than the lower one. This illusion is named after the Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":1908,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://magicperspectives.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/sites/2/2018/12/Ponzo-238x300.png"" alt=""Ponzo illusion"" class=""wp-image-1908""/><figcaption>Ponzo illusion.</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If two circles of the same diameter are surrounded by larger and smaller circles, they appear to be different in size. This deception was discovered by the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. The presence of smaller or larger objects affects our perception of size. This illusion can be used in real life to make portions of food <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/01/28/145865238/deception-diet-how-optical-illusions-can-trick-your-appetite"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""appear smaller (opens in a new tab)"">appear smaller</a> than they are. When a chef serves a meal on a giant plate, it seems smaller than when placed on a standard plate.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last example here is the Poggendorff illusion, first described in 1860. In this illusion, a rectangle covers an oblique line. Although the diagonal line is straight, it seems as if the line is unequal. This illusion was designed by Johann Zöllner, but it was named after Johann Poggendorff, the publisher of the journal in which it appeared.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although these phenomena have been studied for more than a century, the actual cause of these deceptions is still not fully certain. There are several <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-perception"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""competing explanations (opens in a new tab)"">competing explanations</a> of how the brain causes them. However, none of these theories is universally accepted by psychologists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Visual and cognitive illusions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visual illusions occur when the physical circumstances outside our mind deceive us. Distortions of light in our eyes, such as the mirrors in an amusement park, cause these illusions. If you look in a curved mirror, you appear shorter, longer, thicker or thinner. Optical illusions also form the basis of the art of photography. Photographers combine focal length, aperture and shutter speed to make an artful photo. Photography is not a perfect replica of reality, but an interpretation of reality by the photographer through the way she manipulates light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While visual illusions have a physical cause, cognitive illusions arise within our brain. The way our mind interprets the visual stimuli delivered to the brain by the optic nerve causes cognitive illusions. Psychologists and artists have discovered and developed hundreds of cognitive optical illusions, such as the one shown above. Some illusions cause us to perceive movements where there are none, cause us to assign size or colour wrongly, or to show us forms where there is the only space. The psyche interprets the information it receives, and our perception thus systematically deviates from reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Optical illusions in magic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These physical and neurological phenomena make visual and cognitive delusions a perfect tool for magicians to create the illusion of magic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magicians use a variety of techniques to perform magic. Both visual and cognitive delusions form an integral part of the show. Visual illusions are widespread in stage magic, or as they say in English, ""with smoke and mirrors"". The nineteenth-century trick called the Pepper's Ghost is one of the best examples of visual illusions in magic theatre. In this illusion, the magician conjures-up ghostlike figures on stage using an elaborate setup of smoke and mirrors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designers of stage illusions often rely on the principle of cognitive illusions. The magician's assistant hides in carefully designed boxes that seem smaller than they really are. This cognitive illusion creates the idea that a <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""hemicorporectomy (opens in a new tab)"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicorporectomy"" target=""_blank"">hemicorporectomy</a> is performed, while the assistant remains uninjured. The craft of the illusionist requires a good understanding of the physics of visual illusions and the psychology of cognitive illusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to large boxes used to mutilate and restore women, there are also demonstrations of optical illusions in close-up magic. In the Marlo Tilt, the magician seems to place a card in the middle of the deck, while in actual fact it is much closer to the top.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In these examples, optical illusions form the secret method and are not part of the magical effect itself. In the case of stage illusions, the discrepancy in size is not revealed because the cognitive illusion is not the effect but part of the method. Also in 'Marlo Tilt' the cognitive illusion is part of the secret and not the actual magic trick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic tricks where the effect itself is an optical illusion are rare as they are usually easily reconstructed by audiences. The audience is aware of optical illusions, and the method quickly becomes clear. Alleviation of this problem requires additional layers of deception or an appealing presentation to promote the magical appeal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following sections describe some magic tricks that fully exploit our tendency to be fooled by our senses. The Jastrow or <em>Boomerang Illusion</em> is a classic in magic that uses a strong optical illusion. S<em>ay Cheese </em>is a cute trick invented by Robert Hill that uses the ambiguous depth illusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Jastrow Illusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best-known cognitive illusion is the classic boomerang illusion. This magic trick seems to be a cognitive deception that is only useful for entertaining children. A recent Twitter post by BBC journalist Mark Blank-Settle shows that this illusion can also capture the imagination of adults. His video went viral, and news agencies around the world drew attention to his magical illusion.</p>

<p>The first psychologist to describe this illusion as we now know it was not Joseph Jastrow but the German psychologist Franz Müller-Lyer. His article from 1889 presents an extensive collection of geometrical illusions of size. The illusion first published in the English literature by Polish psychologist Joseph Jastrow, whose name is still linked to this principle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shogu Imai from Japan examined the Jastrow illusion in detail. He experimented with different designs and determined the optimal radius and angle to maximise the illusion. The results of his research can be used to produce the perfect prop to perform the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/boomerang-illusion-template/"">boomerang illusion</a>.</p>

<p>The magical literature contains many ideas on how to perform this routine, and there are many versions available in magic shops. The boomerang illusion is a perfect little secret that provides an ideal way to express your creativity. If you want to know more about this venerable trick, then read my book The <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/boomerang-illusion/"">Jastrow Illusion in Magic</a>. This book describes the history of this illusion both from a scientific perspective and its performance history as a magic trick.</p>

<h2>Ambiguous Depth Illusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When interpreting lines as three-dimensional objects, the mind is sometimes confused. The brain interprets some drawings in multiple ways. Famous examples such as the <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube"" target=""_blank"">Necker Cube</a> and the <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroeder_stairs"" target=""_blank"">Schroeder Stairs</a>, shown below, demonstrate this illusion. As you stare at these two images, you notice your mind constantly switching its interpretation between the two possibilities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Necker cube, either the left or right square appears to be at the front. The Schroeder stairs can be viewed as either sitting on the ground or hanging from the ceiling.</p>

1688,Paradoxes of Size: A Treatise on Geometric Vanishes,https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-vanishes/,1575151200,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geometry is one of the most logical human pursuits. Geometry can also be deceiving, and magicians use it to create the illusion of magic. This ebook discusses magic tricks based on geometric vanishes, also known as the&nbsp;<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_square_puzzle"">Missing Square Puzzle</a>. These magic tricks have recently become wildly popular with millions of views on YouTube.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These magic tricks evolved from a mathematical error to an apparent paradox. Magicians have added layers of deception to turn mathematics into a piece of theatre. This book discusses the history and principles of the three types of geometric vanishes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Vanishing Leprechaun</li><li>The Curry Paradox</li><li>The Tangram Paradox</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each chapter is richly illustrated to give the reader insight into how these tricks work. The book also contains various templates that you can use to create your own geometric magic tricks, such as the <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/the-greatest-wall/"">Greatest Wall</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Geometric Magic Tricks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Gozinta Boxes is another famous magic trick that uses geometry. The basic effect is a <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/topological-magic-tricks/"">topological</a> mystery where two boxes fit inside each other. The method for this trick is a clever application of geometry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lubor Fiedler discovered the principle behind the gozinta box when  tidying his house. He placed two empty boxes into each other and noticed  how they seemed to fit almost perfectly. This real-life situation  inspired him to develop the Lubor Die, which later became known as the  Gozinta Boxes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are interested in magic and geometry then you will thoroughly enjoy <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/gozinta-boxes/"">The Box Goes-in-da-Box</a>. This book provides a detailed account of the history, mathematics and performance of this enigmatic trick.</p>

2126,The Greatest Wall: Magic with the Tangram Paradox,https://magicperspectives.net/the-greatest-wall/,1553754170,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People love to build walls. Walls keep people in, or walls keep people out, depending on your perspective. The great wall of China, Hadrian's Wall and the Berlin Wall were once impenetrable, but they all eventually crumbled. No matter how high the wall, people will always find a hole to get through it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The magician shows two pieces of cardboard that form a brick wall. When she turns the pieces to show the other side, the wall now has a hole.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2134} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This trick uses geometry to create the illusion that a hole has appeared in the wall. This method is the same geometric principle that is behind the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Tangram (opens in a new tab)"">Tangram</a> Paradox. Robert Neale developed this trick, based on earlier work by Martin Gardner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ebook <a href=""https://magicperspectives.net/geometric-vanishes/"">Paradoxes of Size</a> discusses the mathematical intricacies of the Tangram Paradox in detail. If you like to know how this principle developed over the past five hundred years, then you should read this book as a perfect companion to the trick.</p>

<h2>Magic Tricks in Dental Health</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sitting in a dentists chair surely is one of the least pleasant experiences of modern life. Some people are so scared of seeing a dentist that they refuse to ever visit these health practitioners. To help young patients reduce their anxiety about dental care, dentists use a range of methods, including magic tricks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem studied the effectiveness of using magic tricks compared with using conventional methods to persuade strong-willed children to sit in the dental chair. In a similar experiment, other researchers found that children who enjoy a magic trick are more agreeable to being x-rayed than those who were not entertained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some dentists in the United States have used a packaged magic show called <em>The Magic of a Healthy Smile</em> as a marketing or motivational tool for dental treatments, while others have taken this concept to the next level and integrated the performance of magic tricks into their practice. <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Dentallusions (opens in a new tab)"" href=""http://www.loudini.com/dentallusions/"" target=""_blank"">Dentallusions</a> is a collection of magic tricks designed exclusively for the dental profession.</p>
