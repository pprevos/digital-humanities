Euler Problem 5 relates to the
[[https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-1/][divisibility of numbers]]
and is an almost trivial problem that is included here only for
completeness.

** Euler Problem 5
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: euler-problem-5
   :END:

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers
from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the
[[https://projecteuler.net/problem=5][smallest positive number that is
evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20]]?

** Solution
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: solution
   :END:

The solution will also be divisible by the numbers 1 to 10 so we can
start at 2520 and increment by 2520. The loop checks whether the number
is divisible by the numbers 1 to 20. You can view the code below or
download the latest version from
[[https://github.com/pprevos/ProjectEuler/blob/master/solutions/problem005.R][GitHub]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  i <- 2520
  while (sum(i %% (1:20)) != 0) {
      i <- i + 2520 # Increase by smallest number divisible by 1:10
  }
  answer <- i
  print(answer)
#+END_EXAMPLE
