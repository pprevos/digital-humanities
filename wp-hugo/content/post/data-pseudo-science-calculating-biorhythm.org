Data science is a serious occupation. Just like any other science,
however, it can also be used for spurious topics, such as calculating
your biorhythm. This article provides an example of data Pseudo-Science
though a function that calculates and visualises your
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm][biorhythm]]. Based on the
graph, I must be having a great day right now.

The broader and more pertinent message in this post is that data
pseudo-science is more common than you would think. Is our belief in
machine learning justified or are some of these models also a
pseudo-science with not much more reliability than a biorhythm?

** Biorhythm Theory
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: biorhythm-theory
   :END:

The idea that our physical states follow a predetermined rhythm has been
around as long as mathematics. The basic concept of biorhythm is that a
regular sinusoid cycle accurately describes our physical, emotional and
intellectual states. Each of these three cycles has a different
wavelength ($latex w$):

- physical: $latex w = 23$ days
- emotional: $latex w = 28$ days
- intellectual: $latex w = 33$ days

The cycle is calculated with $latex \sin (2 \pi t / w)$, where $latex t$
indicates the number of days since birth. This idea was developed by
German surgeon Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19^{th} century and was
popularised in the United States in the late 1970s. There is no
scientific evidence of the validity of this theory, but it is an
entertaining way to play with data.

The combination of the 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days,
while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeat every
21,252 days, 58 years, two months and three weeks. You can, by the way,
never reach a point where all cycles are maximised. The best you can
achieve is 299.7 out of a maximum 300 which occurs when you are 17,003
days old.

** Calculating your Biorhythm

   :END:

When I was a teenager in the 1980s, several books and
[[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v6n9/Biorhythms.html][magazines]]
described computer code to calculate your biorhythm. I used to play with
these functions on my
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family][Atari 130XE]]
computer.

Building a biorhythm calculator in R is easy. This function takes two
dates as input and plots the biorhythm for the two weeks before and
after the date. To calculate your biorhythm, run the function with your
date of birth and target date: =biorhythm("yyyy-mm-dd")=. The default
version uses today as the target. You can download the latest version of
this code on
[[https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/biorhythm.R][GitHub]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  library(ggplot2)
  library(reshape2)
  biorhythm <- function(dob, target = Sys.Date()) {
      dob <- as.Date(dob)
      target <- as.Date(target)
      t <- round(as.numeric(difftime(target, dob)))
      days <- (t - 14) : (t + 14)
      period <- data.frame(Date = seq.Date(from = target - 15, by = 1, length.out = 29),
                           Physical = sin (2 * pi * days / 23) * 100,
                           Emotional = sin (2 * pi * days / 28) * 100,
                           Intellectual = sin (2 * pi * days / 33) * 100)
  period <- melt(period, id.vars = "Date", variable.name = "Biorhythm", value.name = "Percentage")
  ggplot(period, aes(x = Date, y = Percentage, col = Biorhythm)) + geom_line() +
      ggtitle(paste("DoB:", format(dob, "%d %B %Y"))) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(target))
  }
  biorhythm("1969-09-12", "2017-03-30")

** Data Pseudo-Science
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: data-pseudo-science
   :END:

Biorhythms are an early attempt for human beings to predict the future.
Although there is no relationship between this algorithm and reality,
many people believed in its efficacy. Does the same hold true for the
hyped capabilities of machine learning?

Data pseudo-science is not only an issue when people use spurious
mathematical relationships such as biorhythms or astrology. This post is
also written as a warning not to solely rely on numerical models to
predict qualitative aspects of life.

The recent failures in predicting the results of elections, even days
before the event, are a case in point. There are many
[[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/05/8-reasons-analytics-machine-learning-models-fail-deployed/][reasons
machine learning methods can go wrong]]. When machine learning
algorithms fail, they are often just as useful as a biorhythm. It would
be fun to write a predictive analysis package for R using only
pseudoscientific approaches such as I-Ching, astrology or biorhythm.
