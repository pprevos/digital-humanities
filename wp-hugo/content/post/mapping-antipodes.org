When I was a kid, I was was fascinated by the conundrum of what happens
when you drill a hole straight through the centre of the earth. I always
believed that I would turn up in Australia. But is this really the case?

The antipodes of any place on earth is the place that is diametrically
opposite to it. A pair of antipodes are connected by a straight line
running through the centre of the Earth. These points are as far away
from each other as is possible on this planet. Two people are antipodes
when they live on opposite sides of the globe. Their feet (πούς/pous in
Ancient Greek) are directly opposite each other.

How can we use coding in R to solve this conundrum?

We can roughly recreate the antipodean map on Wikipedia with
the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/globe/][/globe/ package]].
This package, written by Adrian Baddeley, plots 2D and 3D views of the
earth. The package contains a data file with major coastlines that can
be used to create a flipped map of the world.

The package contains a data file with major coastlines that can be used
to create a flipped map of the world. To turn a spatial location into
its antipode you subtract 180 degrees from the longitude and reverse the
sign of the latitude, shown below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  library(tidyverse)
  ## Antipodean globe
  world <- map_data("world")
  anti_world <- world %>%
      mutate(long = long - 180,
             lat = - lat)           
  ggplot() +
      geom_polygon(data = world,  aes(long, lat, group = group), fill = "grey") +
      geom_polygon(data = anti_world, aes(long, lat, group = group),
                   fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2) + 
      coord_map("ortho", orientation = c(0, 100, 00)) +
      theme_void()

We can also use
the[[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html][ ggmap package]]
to visualise antipodes. This package, developed by David Kahle
antipodean R-guru Hadley Wickham, has a neat geocoding function to
obtain a spatial location. You will need a Google API to enable the
[[https://lucidmanager.org/geocoding-with-ggmap/][geocoding function]].

The antipode function takes the description of a location and a zoom
level to plot a dot on the antipode location. The gridExtra package is
used to create a faceted map, which is not otherwise possible in ggmap.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  library(gridExtra)
  library(ggmap)
  api <- readLines("google.api") # Text file with the API key
  register_google(key = api)
  ## Antipode function
  antipode <- function(location, zm = 6) {
      # Map location
      lonlat <- geocode(location)
      loc1 <- get_map(lonlat, zoom = zm)
      map1 <- ggmap(loc1) +
          geom_point(data = lonlat, aes(lon, lat, col = "red", size = 10)) + 
          theme(legend.position = "none")
      # Define antipode
      lonlat$lon <- lonlat$lon-180
      if (lonlat$lon < -180) 
          lonlat$lon <- 360 + lonlat$lon
      lonlat$lat <- -lonlat$lat
      loc2 <- get_map(lonlat, zoom = zm)
      map2 <- ggmap(loc2) +
          geom_point(data = lonlat, aes(lon, lat, col = "red", size = 10)) + 
          theme(legend.position = "none")
      grid.arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)
  }

  antipode("Rector Nelissenstraat 47 Hoensbroek", 4)

This code solves the problem I was thinking about as a child. Running
the code shows that the antipodes location of the home I grew up in is
not in Australia, but quite a way south of New Zealand. Another
childhood fantasy shattered ... You can also view this code
