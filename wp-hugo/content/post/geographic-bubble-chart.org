A geographic bubble chart is a straightforward method to visualise
quantitative information with a geospatial relationship. Last week I was
in Vietnam helping the Phú Thọ Water Supply Joint Stock Company with
their data science. They asked me to create a map of a sample of their
water consumption data. In this post, I share this little ditty to
explain how to plot a bubble chart over a map using the ggmap package.

In this post, I share this little ditty to explain how to plot a bubble
chart over a map using the ggmap package. You can find the code and data
for this article on my
[[https://github.com/pprevos/hydroinformatics/tree/master/WaterFlow/PhuTho][GitHub]]
repository. With thanks to Ms Quy and Mr Tuyen of Phu Tho water for
their permission to use this data. Other posts on this blog detail how
to analyse water consumption from
[[https://lucidmanager.org/digital-water-meter-data/][digital metering
data]].

This map visualises water consumption in the targeted area of Việt Trì.
The larger the bubble, the larger the consumption. It is no surprise
that two commercial customers used the most water.
Ggplot automatically adds the legend for the consumption variable.

The sample data contains a list of just over 100 readings from water
meters in the city of Việt Trì in Vietnam, plus their geospatial
location. This data uses the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84),
which is compatible with Google Maps and similar systems.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  water <- read.csv("PhuTho/MeterReads.csv")
  water$Consumption <- water$read_new - water$read_old
  ## Summarise the data
  head(water)
  summary(water$Consumption)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The consumption at each connection is between 0 and 529 cubic metres,
with an average usage of 23.45 cubic metres.

With the
[[https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf][ggmap]]
extension of the ggplot package, we can visualise any spatial data set
on a map. The only condition is that the spatial coordinates are in the
WGS84 datum. The ggmap package adds a geographical layer to ggplot by
adding a Google Maps or Open Street Map canvas. The first step is to
download the map canvas. To do this, you need to know the centre
coordinates and the zoom factor. To determine the perfect zoon factor
requires some trial and error. The ggmap package provides for various
map types, which are described in detail in the
[[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/ggmap.pdf][documentation]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  library(ggmap)
  centre <- c(mean(range(water$lon)), mean(range(water$lat)))
  viettri <- get_map(centre, zoom = 17, maptype = "hybrid")
  g <- ggmap(viettri)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The ggmap package follows the same conventions as ggplot. We first call
the map layer and then add any required geom. The point geom creates
a nice bubble chart when used in combination with the
=scale_size_area option=. This option scales the points to a maximum
size so that they are easily visible. The transparency (alpha) minimises
problems with overplotting. This last code snippet plots the map with
water consumption.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  g + geom_point(data = reads, aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = Consumption),
                 shape = 21, colour = "dodgerblue4", fill = "dodgerblue", 
                 alpha = .5) +
      scale_size_area(max_size = 20) + # Size of the biggest point
      ggtitle("Việt Trì sự tiêu thụ nước")
#+END_EXAMPLE
