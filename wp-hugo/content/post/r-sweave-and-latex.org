One of my favourite activities in R is using Markdown to create business
reports. Most of my work I export to MS Word to communicate analytical
results with my colleagues. For my academic work and eBooks, I prefer
LaTeX to produce great typography. This article explains how to write
academic articles and essays combining R Sweave and LaTeX. The article
is formatted in accordance with the APA (American Psychological
Association) requirements.

To illustrate the principles of using R Sweave and LaTeX, I recycled an
essay about problems with body image that I wrote for a psychology
course many years ago. You can find the completed paper and all the
necessary files on my
[[https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage][GitHub
repository]].

In another post, I have outlined how to achieve the same result using
[[https://lucidmanager.org/using-r-with-emacs/][Emacs and Org Mode]] to
write academic articles.

** Body Image
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: body-image
   :END:

Body image describes the way we feel about the shape of our body. The
literature on this topic demonstrates that many people, especially young
women, struggle with their body image. A negative body image has been
strongly associated with eating disorders. Psychologists measure body
image using a special scale, shown in the image below.

My paper measures the current and ideal body shape of the subject and
the body shape of the most attractive other sex. The results confirm
previous research which found that body dissatisfaction for females is
significantly higher than for men. The research also found a mild
positive correlation between age and ideal body shape for women and
between age and the female body shape found most attractive by men. You
can read the full paper on my other
[[https://prevos.net/humanities/psychology/body-image/][website]].

** R Sweave and LaTeX
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: r-sweave-and-latex
   :END:

The R file for this essay uses the Sweave package to integrate R code
with LaTeX. The first two code chunks create a table to summarise the
respondents using the
[[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html][xtable]]
package. This package creates LaTeX or HTML tables from data generated
by R code.

The first lines of the code read and prepare the data, while the second
set of lines creates a table in LaTeX code. The code chunk uses
=results=tex= to ensure the output is interpreted as LaTeX. This
approach is used in most of the other chunks. The image is created
within the document and saved as a pdf file and back integrated into the
document as an image with an appropriate label and caption.

[[https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage/BodyImage.Rnw][Rnw
file]] on my GitHub repository to see the full code.

I created this file in R Studio, using the
[[https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr][Sweave
and]] knitr functionality. To knit the R Sweave file for this paper you
will need to install the [[https://ctan.org/pkg/apa6][apa6]] and
[[https://ctan.org/pkg/ccicons?lang=en][ccicons]] packages in your LaTeX
distribution. The apa6 package provides macros to format papers in
accordance with the requirements of the American Psychological
Association.
